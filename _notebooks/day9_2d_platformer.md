# 2d Platformer Game

**Note: this project is pretty advanced, so only do this if you feel that you are comfortable with all the material we've covered (including functions and classes). It's also probably going to help if you have some experience creating your own games (e.g. in another language) so you're already familiar with some of the concepts**

In this project, you'll build a 2d platformer game using the `arcade` library. This is a pretty powerful library for creating 2d computer games. Your project is to work through the [2d platformer tutorial](http://arcade.academy/examples/platform_tutorial/index.html). As you work through the tutorial, feel free to embelish your game with your own additional features and graphics to make the game your own!

Before you get started, you'll need to install the `arcade` library. To do this, you'll need to use the terminal. In the jupyter lab environment, hit the '+' sign in the top left to open up the launcher, scroll down to the bottom and click on 'terminal'. This should open up a new tab with a black background and a blinking cursor. In the terminal, type 

```
pip3 install --user arcade
```

If all goes well, this should install `arcade` and all the required dependencies, so if you now open up a new notebook you should be able to run

```
import arcade
```
and you should not get any error messages. If this is not the case, flag down one of the instructors and we'll help you fix it.


```python

```
