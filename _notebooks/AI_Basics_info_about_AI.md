# Artificial intelligence


* \[...\] within a generation \[...\] the problem of creating *artificial intelligence* will substantially be solved. (c) Marvin Minsky, mid-1960s
* How will you understand that AI achieved its goals?
* **Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies** by *Nick Bostrom*

## Areas that are traditionally associated with AI
* Reasoning
* NLP
* Computer vision
* Robotics

### Reasoning

Not a challenge for a human. But how to encode reasoning into a computer?

* Logic
* Machine learning
* Result of extracting knowledge from the world is **ontologies** that show relations among events, companies, people, etc.

### Natural Language Processing

#### Dialogue simulation
**Project:** SwankBot, a bot that has a knowledge base and is capable of giving random answers and even trying to be emotional.

#### Text generation
**Project:** based on an extract from Harry Potter, we will generate new sentences.

#### Speech generation
How to make computers actually speak? For example, [eSpeak](http://espeak.sourceforge.net/commands.html).


```python
import os
os.system("espeak 'lol'")
```

#### Machine translation
**Project(?):** transducer-based machine translation.

### Computer vision

**One of the mian tasks:**
* How not to bump in the walls?
* How to recognize faces and emotions?

If you are interested in working on computer vision with Python, check out [this link](http://www.paulvangent.com/2016/08/05/emotion-recognition-using-facial-landmarks/).


### Robotics
Sophia was the first robot that was awarded citizenship. She is a [citizen of Saudi Arabia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKrV2CVDXjo)!

And of course, there are plenty of intersections of the areas listed above. For example:
* Image-based question answering systems
* Facial emotions imitation
* Reasoning performed by a robot
