# Making music

This aim of this project is to write your own music using python. There are quite a few libraries out there that allow you to create your own tracks and manipulate existing sounds, however for this project we suggest using [EarSketch](https://earsketch.gatech.edu/). This is a free, web-based application that enables you to generate music using python.

To get started, we suggest looking at [this tutorial](https://earsketch.gatech.edu/earsketch2/#?curriculum=8-0-0&language=python) which should introduce you to how the library works. 

After that, try looking at the [Competition page](http://earsketch.gatech.edu/landing/) on the main website, listening to some of the entries and then looking at the code behind them to see if you can understand how they work. 

Where you go from there is up to you: try playing around with the library and building up some basic beats. If you need inspiration, have a look at the documentation to see what other things are possible with the library. 


```python
