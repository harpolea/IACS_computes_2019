    "While accessing outside variables in a function is a cool feature, it's not usually considered a good practice. One of the big advantages of using functions is that it *compartmentalizes* your code. Compartmentalization is a technique where large codes are split into smaller chunks and each coded separately. This affords us not only readable code, but each piece of the code can then be reused later on if necessary (as you continue coding, you'll find yourself reusing your old code a lot!). If a function that you wrote requires an outside variable to work, then it becomes more difficult for you (and others) to reuse later. And if your function changes an outside variable, it can very easily lead to unintended consequences when used as part of a larger code (and this becomes a real pain to debug). If your function needs information from outside, simply write that function to take that information in as an argument, and if your function needs to change something on the outside, write it as an output."
