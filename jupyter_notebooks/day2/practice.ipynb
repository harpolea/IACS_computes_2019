    "When scientists perform experiments, the data that they collect needs to be processed before it can be analyzed. Sometimes the detector may not be working, it might be cloudy so the telescope can't see anything, or the scientist may go to get a coffee and miss a reading. Sometimes things interfere with the readings, leading the strange, *anomalous* readings that are far outside the range of expected values. Before any analysis is performed, the data must therefore be *cleaned* to remove any missing or anomalous values.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we're going to pretend that we've collected some readings of the brightness of a star that we observed using Mount Stony Brook every evening for four weeks. Unfortunately, on a few of those nights it was cloudy, so no reading was taken. In this case, the brightness is recorded as `0`. On a few other nights, the flood lights at the nearby football stadium were turned on, leading to light contamination which produced anomalously large readings. On one night, an anomalously small reading was recorded (maybe the person taking the reading put the decimal point in the wrong place??). \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can analyze our data to work out how bright the star is, we will therefore need to clean it. \n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, create a new list which does not contain any values which are 0, or much smaller/larger than would reasonably be expected. Decide for yourself what to consider to be anomalously small/large values. You should create the new list by using a for loop to iterate over the elements of the list, adding any values which satisfy the criteria to your new list. "
