# Welcome to IACS Python summer camp

Hi and welcome to the website for the **IACS Computes! HS summer camp**. During this camp, students will learn Python programming skills, get to know research challenges for which coding is necessary, and see several real-world applications of coding, including literature analysis, cryptography and data processing. 

- **Dates:** 12-23 August, 9am-3pm
- **Location:** IACS, Stony Brook University, NY
- **Instructors:** Alice Harpole, Lupe Barrios Sazo, Nazila Shafiei

On this page, you will find information about the [schedule](#schedule), [materials](#materials), and how to [install anaconda](#anaconda-installation).
